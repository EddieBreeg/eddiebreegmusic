# Chapter II

Hey folks! Did you know I love December? Quite a nice month. I know that 2020 has not exactly been what
one would call enjoyable, but there is at least something I can do to help. See, on the In The Mix [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sBbsE6e), we're doing an Advent Calendar event. Staff members and Michael Wynne (the owner of the server in case you're not aware) are giving something they made every day of this month. And now it's my turn! *Chapter II* is a demo track I made using only Vital (the new synth from Matt Tytel, I highly recommend you download it if you haven't done it already), and __this is what you're getting for today__:
- an mp3 version of the track
- the FL studio file project (.flp)
- all the presets I used to make it

And you can get everything [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aJr37PKtUtGa-FXy2uQe3RgzmjQXWP3T/view?usp=sharing).\
Doing this we're hoping to give everyone a reason to be happy, even if it's just for an hour or even a minute. Because it does make a difference, am I right?
