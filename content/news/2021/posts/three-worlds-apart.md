# Three Worlds Apart
This is the end of a very special one, if I'm being honest. The reason for that is that not only have we just released
what I can safely say is one of my favorite pieces, but also because I get to say "we made it" and not "I made it".\
I am refering to Three Worlds Apart, the 3-track EP I made in collaboration with [Windklang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTlGShh84yxxKUaIYxMlcqQ)! I cannot help
but encourage you to go through this journey with us, I bet you won't regret it. Come over [this way](/music/three-worlds-apart)!
