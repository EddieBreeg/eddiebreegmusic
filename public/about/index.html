<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there is much to say about me, but I will do my best either way.
I am a music composer and producer. I have pretty much always been into metal stuff,
thanks to my dad, and I started playing the guitar at around 8 years old.</p>
<p>Many years later I discovered synthwave. I had been making music for a while at this point,
always trying to find workarounds to my obvious lack of knowledge, but one day someone told me about a
&ldquo;<em>real</em>&rdquo; audio workstation: Cakewalk. Add that to the fact I was listening to more and more electronic music like Carpenter Brut or Dance With The Dead, and boom a few months later I was working on my first
LP album which was based on a cyberpunk RPG I had created.</p>
<p>Now, well&hellip; things have not changed that much. I learnt a lot of things for sure, I made my way into
new genres I didn&rsquo;t know about but at the of the day I&rsquo;m still this guy making music with whatever means he has and sharing it on the internet&hellip; That&rsquo;s all there is to it I guess.</p>
