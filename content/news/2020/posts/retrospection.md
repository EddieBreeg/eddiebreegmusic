# Retrospection

My new single is out folks! You can check it out [here](/music/retrospection).
And because it's Christmas, we're doing a special event on the In The Mix [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sBbsE6e). In practice what it means is that just as last time with *Chapter II*, I have a gift for you:
a pack containing all the presets I used for *Retrospection*, as well as other presets of mine, for a start.
You'll also get a mp3 version of the track and a wallpaper in reasonable quality. Follow [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cX4DXvKk-E0RwBbeMeoB4-yL3l0pfYPw/view?usp=sharing) to download everything!

I wish you all a great month despite all the crazy stuff hapening in the world!
