# About me

I don't know if there is much to say about me, but I will do my best either way.
I am a music composer and producer. I have pretty much always been into metal stuff,
thanks to my dad, and I started playing the guitar at around 8 years old.

Many years later I discovered synthwave. I had been making music for a while at this point,
always trying to find workarounds to my obvious lack of knowledge, but one day someone told me about a
"*real*" audio workstation: Cakewalk. Add that to the fact I was listening to more and more electronic music like Carpenter Brut or Dance With The Dead, and boom a few months later I was working on my first
LP album which was based on a cyberpunk RPG I had created.

Now, well... things have not changed that much. I learnt a lot of things for sure, I made my way into
new genres I didn't know about but at the of the day I'm still this guy making music with whatever means he has and sharing it on the internet... That's all there is to it I guess.
